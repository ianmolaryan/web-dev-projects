# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to align three of your marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does.


## Features
- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)
- Interactive game board
- Display messages for turns, wins, or draw
- Reset button to restart the game
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Responsive design

## How to Play
1. Player X always starts the game.
2. Players take turns to click on a cell on the grid to place their mark (X or O).
3. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
4. If all the cells are filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game ends in a draw.
5. You can click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game at any time.
